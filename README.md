__Note:__ Unfortunately, this project has been effectively abandoned. There is
enough progress here to be useful for interested parties in the future, but a
lot of things will need to be reconsidered. TFD seems to be functioning fine
anyway, but I do apologize for those I promised this script to.

This is an English Wikipedia
[user script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_scripts) to automate
common
[templates for discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion)
operations, including closures and relisting.

It lives on-wiki at

To install it, add the following to your
